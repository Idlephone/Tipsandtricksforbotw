    In the divine beast dungeon songs, you can hear a faint SOS in Morse code. Revali's SOS started later pointing out that he survived the longest.

        The Stable song is a reference to Epona's theme.
    </li>
    <br><li>
      Monk Maz Koshia's theme is a remix of the Shrine battle song.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the hyrule  castle interior theme, you can hear a faint heartbeat, getting faster and faster as the song goes on, then flatlines.
    </li>
    <br><li>
      The guidance stone song is a slowed down version of Ocarina of Time's chest open theme.
    </li>
    <br><li>
In the Champion's Ballad 12 Champion shrines, instead of the regular shrine songs, a slowed down version the the Champion's Ballad song plays. 
    </li>
    <br><li>
The talus theme sounds like an unsuspecting miner striking his pickaxe on a talus by accident, waking the stone colossal.
    </li>
    <br><li>
      “The Last King of Hyrule” song is played when the Old Man shows his identity, but it's a reference to “Farwell Hyrule King” from the Windwaker.
    </li>
    <br><li>
      Fi's song can be heard in the Zelda's Awakening memory, The Master Sword memory, and after the completion of the Trial of the Sword.
    </li>
    <br><li>
      Shrine songs use different “phrases” that randomly play one after the other. That's why you'll never hear the same song twice in the same shrine.
